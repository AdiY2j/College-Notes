## Intelligent Agents
### What is an agent?
* An **agent** is an entity that
  * **perceives** its enviroment through sensors (e.g. eyes, ears, cameras, sensors)
  * **acts** on its environment through effectors (e.g. hands, legs, motors)
* A **rational agent** is one which does the right thing.
  * **Rational action:** action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.
  * **Rationality** depends on:
    * Performance measure that defines the criterion of success
    * Actions that the agent can perform
    * Percept
    * Environment (States)
