# Artificial Intelligence Part I
## Intelligent Agents
### What is an agent?
* An **agent** is an entity that
  * **perceives** its enviroment through sensors (e.g. eyes, ears, cameras, sensors)
  * **acts** on its environment through effectors (e.g. hands, legs, motors)
* A **rational agent** is one which does the right thing.
  * **Rational action:** action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.
  * **Rationality** depends on:
    * Performance measure that defines the criterion of success
    * Actions that the agent can perform
    * Percept
    * Environment (States)
* An **autonomous agent** does not rely entirely on built-in knowledge about the environment. It adapts to the environment through experience i.e. *learning*.
* An **agent program** is a function that implements the agent mapping from the percepts to actions.

### Types of Agents
#### Simple Reflex Agent

#### Reflex Agents with States (Model-Based)

#### Goal-Based Agents

#### Utility-Based Agents

### Types of Enviroment

* **Accessible (vs Inaccessible):**
* **Deterministic (vs Non-Deterministic / Stochastic):** 
* **Discrete (vs Continuous):**
* **Episodic (vs Sequential):**
* **Observable (vs Partially-Observable):**
* **Single agent (vs Multiple agents):**
* **Static (vs Dynamic):**
